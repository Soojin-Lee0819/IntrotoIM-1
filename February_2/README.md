# A Growing Circle
The big pink circle follows your mouse while other little circles are randomly moving around the window. I added more vibrance by changing the color of small circles regularly. The main circle will get bigger when it collides with other small circles. Once the main circle reaches its maximum radius and gets bigger than the window, the motion will stop.
