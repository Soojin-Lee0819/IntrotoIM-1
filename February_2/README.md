# A Growing Circle :v:
The big pink circle follows your mouse while other little circles are randomly moving around the window. I added more vibrance by changing the color of small circles regularly. The main circle will get bigger when it collides with other small circles. Once the main circle reaches its maximum radius and gets bigger than the window, the motion will stop.

#### Code ####
* I used object oriented programming(OOP) using two classes, one for main circle and one for small circles, and functions.
* I used for loop to generate the coordinates for small circles and when applying functions for each of small circles.
* The information of small circles were stored in an array of integers, and an array of class for small circles I created.

#### Difficulties ####
* It took some time for me to find out how the loop and animation works in the draw() function. As the draw functions are keep repeated, I had to be careful using loops in functions for other classes. Otherwise, the motion of circles and change in colors would go so fast and looked very unorganized.
* While I tried to create an array of instaces of the class I created, I found it little difficult to use the syntax. There were some important things to keep in mind to use an array for the class. <br>
***ClassName[] ArrayName = new ClassName [int];<br>***
***ArrayName[index]=new ClassName (parameters);<br>***

#### What I enjoyed creating this ####
I enjoyed adding the interactive element to this work so that users can control the pathway of circle. I found that there are so many ways to apply one function and it would appear very different depending on how you use it. I loved how setting variables and conditions for variables can make the program more sophisticated and realize what I wanted to describe easily.
