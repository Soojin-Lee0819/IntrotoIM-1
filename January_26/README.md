# Self Portrait

In the self portrait, I wanted include some of my preferences. As my favorite flower is sunflower, I tried to draw it on the clothes. The colors were also chosen based on my love for pastel colors. I used pastel green color for the background and pastel blue for my clothes. I had the short hair for over 5 years now, so I also included that in the self-portrait. Moreover, although it is very trivial, I added some cheek blusher, which is my favorite make-up. Overall, in the portrait, I added things that I love the most. 

### Difficulties ###
I had some difficulties finding the right angle to rotate the shape that I drew on the sketch. The way I used was trying various angles with different shapes. After more tries, I definitely was able to gain more sense which angle I should be putting in. It was easier to put the shapes in the right coordinate after translating the shape in the center of the window using the embedded function.

### What I enjoyed ###
It was interesting to make a self-portrait through processing since I could make a actual drawing of myself using the basic shapes such as rectangle, ellipse, circle, and triangle. It was also satisfying to show my preferences.
